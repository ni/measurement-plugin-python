## NI-DCPower Source DC Voltage

This is a measurement plug-in example that sources and measures a DC voltage with an
NI SMU.

### Features

- Uses the `nidcpower` package to access NI-DCPower from Python
- Demonstrates how to cancel a running measurement by breaking a long wait into
  multiple short waits
- Pin-aware, supporting multiple sessions, multiple pins, and multiple selected
  sites
  - Sources the same DC voltage level on all selected pin/site combinations
  - Measures the DC voltage and current for each selected pin/site combination
- Includes InstrumentStudio and Measurement Plug-In UI Editor project files
- Includes multiple UI files. Note: InstrumentStudio only displays the 1st UI
  file. To change the UI file used for the example, simply switch the order of
  the `ui_file_paths` array in `measurement.py`
- Includes a TestStand sequence showing how to configure the pin map, register
  instrument sessions with the session management service, and run a measurement
  - For the sake of simplicity, the TestStand sequence handles pin map and
    session registration and unregistration in the `Setup` and `Cleanup`
    sections of the main sequence. For **Test UUTs** and batch process model use
    cases, these steps should be moved to the `ProcessSetup` and
    `ProcessCleanup` callbacks.
- Uses the NI gRPC Device Server to allow sharing instrument sessions with other
  measurement services when running measurements from TestStand

### Required Software

- InstrumentStudio 2024 Q3 or later
- NI-DCPower
- Recommended: TestStand 2021 SP1 or later

### Required Hardware

This example requires an NI SMU that is supported by NI-DCPower (e.g.
PXIe-4141).

By default, this example uses a physical instrument or a simulated instrument
created in NI MAX. To automatically simulate an instrument without using NI MAX,
follow the steps below:
- Create a `.env` file in the measurement service's directory or one of its
  parent directories (such as the root of your Git repository or
  `C:\ProgramData\National Instruments\Plug-Ins\Measurements` for statically
  registered measurement services).
- Add the following options to the `.env` file to enable simulation via the
  driver's option string:

  ```
  MEASUREMENTLINK_NIDCPOWER_SIMULATE=1
  MEASUREMENTLINK_NIDCPOWER_BOARD_TYPE=PXIe
  MEASUREMENTLINK_NIDCPOWER_MODEL=4141
  ```

> **Note**
>
> The multi-site pin map, `NIDCPowerSourceDCVoltageMultiSite.pinmap`, requires
> an NI SMU with 4 or more channels.
