# Measurement Services Support for Python

This repo contains the necessary Python Measurement templates and examples to call into the Measurement Services.

Recommended Python Version: 3.8

## Examples

### DC Measurement

DC Measurement is a simple python based example that interacts with DCPower 4145 Instrument.

#### Steps to run the dc_measurement

1. **Setting up python and the virtual environment with required dependency.** This step is only for first-time users.

    1. Make sure the system has the recommended python version installed.

    2. Open a Command prompt and change the working directory to `..\examples\dc_measurement`

    3. Create a Virtual Environment.
        - Command: `python -m venv venv`. This creates a virtual environment named venv

    4. Activate the Virtual Environment.
        - Command : `venv\scripts\activate`.
        - After successful activation, you can see the name of the environment, here `(venv)` tag, added to the command prompt.
        - Optionally user can upgrade the pip within the venv by executing the command: `python -m pip install -U pip`

    5. Installing all the requirements.
        - Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        - This installs all the requirements for dc_measurement to the active virtual environment.
2. Start the discovery service if not already started. As of Jan 2022, Discovery Service will be auto-started only if you are working with a screen file-based measurement plugin.

3. Make sure the resource name of the available DCPower 4145 is the same as the string value set for the `RESOURCE_NAME` constant in the metadata.py.

4. Activate the virtual environment if not already activated.
    - Command : `venv\scripts\activate`.
    - After successful activation, you can see the name of the environment, here `(venv)` tag, added to the command prompt.

5. Run the `__main__`.py from the dc_measurement directory. You will see a window similar to the image below. The Port number might be different in your case. Now the measurement is ready for interaction from clients.

6. After the usage of Measurement, deactivate the virtual environment.
     - Command : `deactivate`.

#### Overview on the Components of dc_measurement

1. `__main__`.py
    - This is the start-up file. Users can run this file to start the measurement.
    - Do not edit this file.

2. metadata.py
    - This file provides information about the measurement. For instance, The python file that holds the measurement method is configured here.
    - Do not edit the name of this file.
    - The **Value** of Constants within the file is user-editable. Do not rename/remove the constants.

3. measurement.py
    - This file's name is user-configurable. The file name should match with the `MEASUREMENT_MODULE_NAME` configured in metadata.py.
    - This file contains the measurement method. The Measurement method name by default is `measure`. This method name is also user-configurable. The Method name should match with the `MEASUREMENT_METHOD_NAME` configured in metadata.py
        - The output of the measurement method should be a tuple of double(as of Jan 2022) and the name of each output in the tuple is correspondingly configured via `MEASUREMENT_OUTPUTS` in metadata.py. These output names are used to display back the outputs in the UI.

4. DCMeasurementScreen.isscr
    - UI file for the Measurement.
    - The Name of this file is configured by `SCREEN_FILE_NAME` in metadata.py

Note: DC Measurement currently supports only the double datatype for the Configuration (Input Parameters of `measure` method) and Output Values(Return Values of `measure` method).

## Template

Template support is coming soon. :)
